Description: These package contains some plotting tools at the moment. They help
    make my life easier when analyzing omics data. But they are not neccesarily the
    best way to do things. Indeed, I expect them to contain many errors, bad choices
    and limitations. You have been warned.
Depends: ggplot2, Biobase, dplyr
Imports: SummarizedExperiment, limma, edgeR, viridis, stats, reshape2, norm, impute, grid, VennDiagram
